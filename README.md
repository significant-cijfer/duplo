# duplo

I be experimenting type shi  
No codegen yet, I be focussing on the type system (I'm too lazy to care about such trivial tasks)  

To run the main example:  
```sh
zig build run -- main.dup
```

If you see no weird red text saying the most incomprehensible shit ever, you're good :p  
You just wrote valid code, congrats!
